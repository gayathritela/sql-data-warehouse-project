# SQL Data Warehouse Project

This project demonstrates the end-to-end development of a modern data warehouse using **SQL Server**. It follows the **Medallion Architecture** and simulates integrating data from multiple business systems (ERP and CRM) into a centralized analytical store using ETL best practices, dimensional modeling, and SQL scripting.

---

## ðŸ§± Architecture Overview

The solution is designed using a three-layered Medallion Architecture:

### ðŸ¥‰ Bronze Layer â€“ Raw Data Ingestion
- Raw CSV exports from ERP and CRM systems are ingested.
- Data is loaded into staging tables without transformation.
- Serves as the immutable source of truth.

### ðŸ¥ˆ Silver Layer â€“ Cleansed & Integrated Data
- Standardization, deduplication, and normalization are applied.
- Null handling, type casting, and relationship building (joins).
- Integrates raw data into structured business entities.

### ðŸ¥‡ Gold Layer â€“ Star Schema (Analytics-Ready)
- Business-ready fact and dimension tables are created:
  - `Fact_Sales`
  - `Dim_Customers`
  - `Dim_Products`
  - `Dim_Employees`
  - `Dim_Location`
  - `Dim_Date`
- Optimized for BI tools and analytical querying.
